We have decided to make a web app and for each part of problem statement we will have sections and we will cover all the natural disasters .
## Before disaster strikes:
1. We will have a prediction model which will predict the intensity of few common disaster on the respective scales they are calculated , the user would just need to tell the area of residence our web app will obtain the information about the place from the satellite directly .
2. For awareness throughout  the year there will be people who will write blogs and also make videos for our webapp . And the ones who will write these post will include NGOâ€™s , students who would be studying these subjects on disaster management(Actually we will introduce this web app in there institutes so that by writing blogs they will be able to serve there motive of studying the subject),we are planning to join hands with professionals to write blogs.
## During Disaster 
1. On the main page all the major problems that the people of that affected region would be facing will be hilighted , specifying the donation needed to help and all other basic requirements like food clothes e.t.c. and persuading people to donate towards the nobel cause.
2. Next we will have section where volunteers could register .(giving basic details like phone number , email id) 
3. We will have voluteers for different sections and for each sections there will be diferent types of volunteers and people will have liberty to pick any volunteer group. 
4. Volunteer group comprises of :
*Ones going to affected sites
* Ones indulged in collecting donations and also looking after social media that problems anfd griefs of the people reach to local public.
* Ones involved only with transportation.
* (might add few more groups for volunteer).
5. For each volunteer group type we will design there page differently say ,ones going to affected places , there will be a link for a chatting forum . So that all of them can discuss stuff. There will be a section on page where volunteers can post all the major problems that they have seen people are facing . There will be a section where the admin will finally put a list of targets to be achived in that week . 
## After disaster :
